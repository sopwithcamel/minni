\section{Problem Definition}

\section{Previous Work}

As a foundation, we are designing our implementation based on the original 
description of MapReduce~\cite{mapreduce08}.  Other systems such as
Dryad~\cite{dryad07} provide design considerations and expose areas
where we can innovate with our implementation.  Our implementation on top
of FAWN~\cite{fawn09} introduces a particular constraint that the original
MapReduce design did not consider: low memory.  In addition, FAWN uses
flash storage as its principal storage medium which introduces another
area for MapReduce research---the original MapReduce design assumes a
storage medium of hard drives.  

Several other competing MapReduce implementations, such as
Disco~\cite{disco10}, Hadoop~\cite{hadoop10}, Sector and
Sphere~\cite{sphere09}, offer more examples to draw from for design
decisions.  Research has also shown that techniques such as merging the
MapReduce stages~\cite{barrier10}, and dynamically prioritizing resource
usage~\cite{sandholm09} offer substantial performance benefits over the
standard MapReduce design---techniques which have only been simulated
before.  Finally, we can take advantage of FAWN's energy efficiency which is
an active area of research with MapReduce as reflected in
Gordon~\cite{gordon09},  and work analyzing MapReduce traces for future
energy efficiency goals~\cite{chen10}.
