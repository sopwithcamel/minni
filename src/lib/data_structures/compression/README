Leaf nodes:

In the case of the compressed buffer tree, the leaf nodes must actually contain
the data and not just pointers to data. This causes greater overhead when
splitting leaf nodes (because data must be actually copied to another leaf's
buffer rather than just pointers), but is necessary for the benefits of
compression.


Insert:
* always split node when the number of children is greater than the number
 allowed
* splitting is always performed on nodes with empty buffers. This happens
 naturally because of the structure of the buffer tree. A leaf can be split
 only after the buffers of all nodes on the path from the root to that leaf
 have had their buffers emptied.
