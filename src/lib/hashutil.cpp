 * Fowler/Noll/Vo hash
 *
 * The basis of this hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent
 * as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 committee by:
 *
 *      Phong Vo (http://www.research.att.com/info/kpv/)
 *      Glenn Fowler (http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/)
 *
 * In a subsequent ballot round:
 *
 *      Landon Curt Noll (http://www.isthe.com/chongo/)
 *
 * improved on their algorithm.  Some people tried this hash
 * and found that it worked rather well.  In an EMail message
 * to Landon, they named it the ``Fowler/Noll/Vo'' or FNV hash.
 *
 * FNV hashes are designed to be fast while maintaining a low
 * collision rate. The FNV speed allows one to quickly hash lots
 * of data while maintaining a reasonable collision rate.  See:
 *
 *      http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/index.html
 *
 * for more details as well as other forms of the FNV hash.
 ***
 *
 * NOTE: The FNV-0 historic hash is not recommended.  One should use
 *	 the FNV-1 hash instead.
 *
 * To use the 32 bit FNV-0 historic hash, pass FNV0_32_INIT as the
 * uint32_t hashval argument to fnv_32_buf() or fnv_32_str().
 *
 * To use the recommended 32 bit FNV-1 hash, pass FNV1_32_INIT as the
 * uint32_t hashval argument to fnv_32_buf() or fnv_32_str().

// 2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
//    machines.
